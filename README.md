# My-Weather-App-2.0

Built a second weather app as the final project for the SheCodes Plus workshop, themed on Japanese woodblock paintings by early 20th century painter, Ohara Koson. 

The background image changes based on the current weather condition of the city. The five-day forecast uses weather icons.
